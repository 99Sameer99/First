# First
My first repo
Here I will put some of the coding projects I did while learing to be a software developer.
# Rock-paper-scissors #
In Rock-paper-scissors I used text file to save player data and update them too instead of using 
SQL because I have used SQL in simple banking project that I did and I was that confident in handling files in python 
so to practice I used files.
In rock paper scissors game you can enter your own hands or play with simple 3 hand rock paper scissors
your name will be saved with score and you can continue later from the saved rating
for drwa you get 50 points for win 100 and for loss 0.
